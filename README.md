- ## [Demonstration](https://vituallab-by0xarchangel.netlify.app/demonstration.html)
  This page contains GIFs that explain the usage of every button in the simulation.

- ## [Calculation and Simulation](https://vituallab-by0xarchangel.netlify.app/calculation.html)
  The actual base conversion simulator. Enter the value in the input box and select the base of the value from the drop-down. Choose the one of the base to which it can be converted and click one of the buttons:  
    - Convert  
     The steps involved in the conversion are also displayed. The app is made to be prone free while feeding input, so error alert may pop up with invalid input.
